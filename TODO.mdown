Eventually there should be a GUI app (Pycocoa or something), but in the meantime:

- Test on several Macs
- Simpler way to manage bad sites (~/.bad_sites like original Undop?)
- Plugins to annoy:
  - Growl something
  - Eject CD (the noise is annoying)
  - Bring up Dashboard
  - Switch display to night mode and back
  - Dim an external display

  The possibilites are endless here.
  
- Perhaps use tuntap/libpcap instead of tcpdump.
